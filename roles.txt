TASKS

1. Graphical plots of GHI data to understand GHI data. Ensure that observations from the plots are recorded. Try to plot derived data as well for feature extraction.
2. Description of parameters present in the dataset (column headers). Try to write it in own words (or humanise if gpt-ing).Describe relevance of each parameter to solar energy.
3. Plot the correlation matrices of GHI against other parameters. Write an observation note.
4. Normality test for the GHI data. (Do a proper hypothesis test using proportion for this alongside other methods). Identify suitable distribution if not normal.
5. Analysis of Trend, Seasonality, Cyclicity and Randomness in dataset
6. Using AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA for forecasting. Use different evaluation metrices such as MAE, RMSE, MAPE for evaluation. tabulate comparison between methods at the end.
7. implementing other techniques (other statistical models, ml models, etc.) to forecast the GHI. Use the same metrics for evaluating and tabulate results if implementing.
8. LaTeX report writing
