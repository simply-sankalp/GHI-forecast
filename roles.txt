TASKS

1. Graphical plots of GHI data to understand GHI data. Ensure that observations from the plots are recorded. Try to plot derived data as well for feature extraction.
2. Description of parameters present in the dataset (column headers). Try to write it in own words (or humanise if gpt-ing).Describe relevance of each parameter to solar energy.
3. Plot the correlation matrices of GHI against other parameters. Write an observation note.
If cross-corr is high, then perhaps discriminant analysis is not suitable, factor analysis better and so on
4. Normality test for the GHI data. (Do a proper hypothesis test using proportion for this alongside other methods). Identify suitable distribution if not normal.
5. Analysis of Trend, Seasonality, Cyclicity and Randomness in dataset
6. Using AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA for forecasting. Find autocorrelation and cross-correlation, and other applicable things. Use different evaluation metrices such as MAE, RMSE, MAPE for evaluation. tabulate comparison between methods at the end.
Also take care of post modelling checks and metrics such as goodness of fit tests (KS test, AIC, log likelihood) etc
7. Implementing other techniques (other statistical models, ml models, etc.) to forecast the GHI. Use the same metrics for evaluating and tabulate results if implementing.
Traditional statistical models such as gamma, exp, weibull etc. Do parameter estimation via MLE
For ML models, try LSTM and PCA based regression and any other models if they feel suitable
8. LaTeX report writing
